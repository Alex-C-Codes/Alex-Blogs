            <h2>Hope</h2>
            <h4>Written/pusblished 10/3/22</h4>
            <p>
                There are movements in place that are too large and heavy to be stopped. Movements like humanism, materialism, rationalism, scientism, modernity, and more have been in motion since the Renaissance in the 15th century. The seeds for many of these movements were planted in the 13th century. They have only continued to gain weight and momentum and will come crashing down - crushing almost everything beneath them in their monstrous enormity.
            </p>
            <p>    
                While the imminent calamity cannot be stopped, I do place my hopes here:
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we can plant the seeds that will germinate for those to come. This is outlined in the story of St. Christopher carrying the Christ-child - a seed of positive change - across the river. In crossing the river with Christ on his back, he leaves behind one world and enters into a new one. This is also shown in Isaac Asimov’s science fiction series: “Foundation." In this story, the mathematician protagonist predicts the imminent fall of a Galactic Empire. Realizing that the motions are already in place so that the empire's fall is inevitable, he devises a plan to limit the timespan of the Dark Age that will follow as a result of the empire's collapse. His plan involves building an institution of religious leaders dedicated to the study and preservation of science and religion. Another example that comes to mind is in Walter M. Miller Jr.’s “Canticle for Leibowitz” in which Leibowitz - a scientist - establishes a monastery dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and books after the world is set aflame via nuclear apocalypse. And finally, in “I Am Legend” - I’ve only seen the Will Smith movie interpretation - the main character isn’t able to stop the calamity from happening. Will Smith's character also fails in being able to save himself from the zombie horde at the end of the movie. But he succeeds in saving the woman and the child. And in the process of saving them, he also hands them the cure for the disease - thus helping secure the hope and future of humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In each of these stories, the heros fail in stopping the apocalypse or collapse from happening. Where they succeed, though, is in preserving and cultivating the seeds of knowledge and hope for future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, I don't have hope that the cataclysm can be stopped. However, I have hope that we can cultivate and plant seeds that will germinate for future generations. Just like the seeds for the Renaissance began in the 13th century but didn’t fully sprout until the 15th, today we must plant seeds in the 21st century - not with the hopes that we can stop the flood from happening - but with the hope that future generations may discover the trees we cultivate today and find nourishment from their fruits.
