                <p>
                    Chapter 1:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reprobus wanders the wasteland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 2:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reprobus serves as soldier at the king's court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 3: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reprobus returns to the wasteland to serve a new Lord - more powerful than the previous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 4: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While serving this more powerful Lord, Reprobus discovers a third - even greater King to serve and goes off searching for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 5: The River Crossing
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, Reprobus finds a monk who instructs him how to find the more powerful King. The monk tells Reprobus to live by a river and to help anyone cross the river who desires to do so. Eventually, a child comes along and asks for help in crossing the river. Reprobus agrees and lifts the child onto his back. As he's crossing the river, the child becomes heavier and heavier - until the Reprbous feels like the weight of the entire world is on his shoulders. Reprobus desparately struggles to wade through the river - almost drowning in the process. But he does get across the river. Once across, it is revealed to him that the child is Christ.
