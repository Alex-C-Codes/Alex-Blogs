            <h2>Apocalypse in Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>
            <h4>Written/pusblished 10/3/22</h4>
            <div>
                <h5>Let There Be Light</h5>
                <p>
                    The Breath of the Wild is a modern day masterpiece in the post-apocalypse genre. The world is barren of any civilization. Though it is filled with trees, boulders, mountains, and other natural landmarks, monsters like bokoblins, moblins, guardians, and lynels - to name a few of them - have spread across the world. Ruins of a past civilization dot the landscape. The only communities around are small and few and far between. The castle at the center of the world is shrouded in darkness. In short: the world has ended. Hyrule is a wasteland. Link awakens in a world that has fallen to darkness and calamity. This darkness is embodied by Ganon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the outset, players are told [play clip] "Link... You are the light -- our light -- that must make Hyrule shine once again. Now, go..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Link must embody the light that is needed to save the world from calamity and devastation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Great Plateau, there is no kingdom. There is no town. The only markers of civilization are the old man, his cabin, and the ancient ruins of the Temple of Time.
